title: Things I Make

I don't only draw comics. I like to try new things to find more ways to create funny or interesting content. You can see the results below! Have fun!

## youdontsurf Things

This 'youdontsurf' thing is basically taking stock material and adding some text. I've made a few GIFs which a lot of people on the internet loved. But see for yourself:

## Horror Doodle Things

I recently started to draw silly faces on scary things. There's more to come!

## Photoshopped Things

I photoshopped a few things and made some bad puns. A couple of them only make sense in German, though. Take a look:
