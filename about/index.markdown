# lolnein

‘lolnein’ is a neologism composed of the acronym ‘loll’ (laughing out loud) and the German interjection ‘nein’ (which translates as ‘no’) negating a question that the user finds to be totally absurd or ridiculous.

# Me

I'm a 20-year-old guy with a passion for drawing and making people laugh. Those two characteristics motivated me to create a web comic.
